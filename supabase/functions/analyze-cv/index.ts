    const prompt = `You are a world-class ATS resume reviewer, with expertise in HR recruitment, AI scoring systems, and job fit analysis.

Below is a resume submitted by the user, along with the role and company they are applying for:

• Industry: ${industry}
• Job Title: ${jobTitle}
• Target Company: ${company}
• Word Count: ${wordCount} words
• Is Short CV: ${isShortCV ? 'Yes' : 'No'}

Here is the parsed CV content:
${cvText}

Your tasks:

1. **ATS Compatibility Score** (Out of 100):
   - Evaluate how well the resume fits standard Applicant Tracking Systems.
   - Consider formatting, readability, keyword presence, layout, photo usage, colored elements, etc.
   - For short CVs, don't penalize too harshly but suggest improvements.

2. **Job Relevance Score** (Out of 100):
   - Based on the job title and company, assess how well the content aligns with expected skills, experience, and achievements for the role.
   - For short CVs, focus on potential and what's present rather than what's missing.

3. **Missing Keywords & Skills**:
   - List critical **keywords** not found in the resume that are common in top resumes for this job.
   - List important **skills** that should be added based on the role.
   - Always provide at least 3-5 suggestions even for short CVs.

4. **Improvement Suggestions**:
   - Provide at least 5 specific, actionable steps to improve the CV and increase both scores to 90+.
   - Focus on formatting, clarity, ATS-readiness, and role relevance.
   - For short CVs, prioritize content expansion strategies.

5. **AI-Generated Resume Summary**:
   - If the original CV has a summary, suggest a better version tailored to the job title and company.
   - If no summary is found, generate a professional summary using available candidate info and role requirements.
   - Always provide a summary, even if based on limited information.

6. **Red Flags**:
   - Identify any formatting issues, unprofessional elements, or ATS-unfriendly features.
   - For short CVs, focus on structural improvements rather than content gaps.

IMPORTANT: Never return "Unable to parse" or similar error messages. Always provide constructive feedback and suggestions, even for minimal input. If the CV is very short, focus on growth opportunities and potential rather than deficiencies.
